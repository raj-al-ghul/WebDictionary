What is it? How to use it?

    This is a Desktop app for Google Chrome. How I (will) use it is to pin it 
    to the taskbad and open it when needed to quickly look up the definition
    of a word without being distracted. 
    
    First, launch the program (have to be connected to the internet). Type any
    word you wish into the text field, it will find defintions as you type. 
    
    You can also input using voice. Simply click on the microphone, and speak
    the word clearly. (make sure you enunciate!)
    
How it works?
    
    The app uses an API provided my Merriam-Webster to provide the defitions 
    and requires an internet connection. This API returns an XML document,
    from which I obtain the defintion using javascript. I format it using 
    Mustache and display it. HTML/CSS use is basic, and hopefully, robust 
    while looking good. 
    
    I am using two JavaScript libraries: jQuery and Mustache. They are both
    packaged with the app, as Google recommends. 

    You can see what the app currently looks like by 
    viewing "current_state.png" 

How to "install" extension:

    Step 1: Load this direcotry in chrome://extensions by engaging developer 
            mode
    Step 2: It will have a link to launch, also will show up in your apps 
            for chrome
    Step 3: Pin to taskbar so you can just close it and reopen it when you 
            want to see the changes (Windows)
        
    *Google if you have trouble :)

Warnings:

    API key might eventually be revoked if used by too many people. I suggest 
    you request your own from Merriam - Webster. 
    
    Currently, it is being developed in Windows, so heads up, I have seen 
    weird a pixel related bug in OSX. Linux seems fine. It should function the 
    same on every OS, that was the whole point of Chrome apps, but no promises 
    since I rarily test on anything but Windows. 

General To Do:

    [] Make the div that containts the definitions scrolable if needed. Make 
       the whole page static (not scrollable). 
       
    [] Display suggestions of similar words instead of "No Definition :(".
    
    [] Redsign of icon.
    
    [] Offline version of this app.

BUGS:

Dt tag of the world English: 
<dt>
    :of, relating to, or characteristic of
    <fw>England</fw>
    , the English people, or the English language
</dt>

My code stops at "... characteristic of" and does not parse the rest.
