This is a Desktop app for Google Chrome / Chromium (havn't tested much on this). Currently, it is being developed in Windows, so heads up, I have seen weird a pixel related bug in OSX. Linux seems fine. It should function the same on every OS, that was the whole point of Chrome apps, but no promises since I rarily test on anything but Windows. 

The app uses an API provided my Merriam-Webster to provide the defitions and requires an internet connection. 

You can see what the app currently looks like by viewing "current_state.PNG" 

How to "install" extension:

Step 1: Load this direcotry in chrome://extensions by engaging developer mode
Step 2: It will have a link to launch, also will show up in your apps for chrome
Step 3: Pin to taskbar so you can just close it and reopen it when you want to see the changes (Windows)

*Google if you have trouble :)

General To Do:

1. Display defintions along with part of speech
2. Fix Bugs
3. Improve the design
